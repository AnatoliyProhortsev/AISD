In the field of data compression, Shannon-Fano coding is a technique for constructing a prefix code based on a set of symbols and their probabilities(estimated ormeasured). It is suboptimal in the sense that it does not achieve the lowest possible expected code word length like Huffman coding; however unlike Huffman coding, it does guarantee that all code word lengths are within one bit of their theoretical ideal - logP(x). The technique was proposed in Claude Elwood Shannon's "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", his 1948.
